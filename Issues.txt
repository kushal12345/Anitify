Frontend
===============
2. after registering as artist by user i get success message but i'm not automatically  navigating to artist home page 
        solution:
        1. instead of automatically navigating to home page redirect to login page
3. artist profile bio is undefined and i cannot re-edit it
4. upload tracks - i think collab artist is not necessary but still it should not be empty 
6. show popup notification in Adminalbum when notlogged user tries to like saying login first
7. sometimes image not loading properly image glitch
8. logout after x time without any activity
9. when i refresh page i get loggedout
10. phone responsive 
12  while login email uppercase and lowercase matters fix it
13 when user logges in and selects profile picture and then upgrades account to artist then old image is removed
14 change your albums to playlist in sidebar and option to create a new playlist in sidebar
15. /login i cannot back to home
16 need to add like to tracks
17 recommended songs based on likes and user's personal interest 
18 multiple users added on likealbum users array
(priority)
20 code sanitization
21 api fetch from backend takes time as time goes on (not fixed but it is slow)
22 sorting tracks and albums
23 album with tracks page fix on header total songs and totoal time  and year 
24 after loggedin if a go back back then side bar is logged in and right page is not (half is logged in and half is not)
