Frontend
===============
2. after registering as artist by user i get success message but i'm not automatically  navigating to artist home page 
        solution:
        1. instead of automatically navigating to home page redirect to login page
3. artist profile bio is undefined and i cannot re-edit it
4. upload tracks - i think collab artist is not necessary but still it should not be empty 
6. show popup notification in Adminalbum when notlogged user tries to like saying login first
7. sometimes image not loading properly image glitch
8. logout after x time without any activity
9. when i refresh page i get loggedout
10. phone responsive 
12  while login email uppercase and lowercase matters fix it
13 when user logges in and selects profile picture and then upgrades account to artist then old image is removed
